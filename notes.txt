+ Exit gracefully when exception thrown (e.g. infinite switch mode loop)
+ IndicatorManager should listen for mouse position and give it to WindowsIndicator
+ Update hint windows when screens changed?
+ Hint undo key could be a combo instead of a key
+ Rename Mouse, Wheel, etc. to Mouse/Wheel/...Configuration
+ mode.blinking-mouse.enabled/visible-duration/invisible-duration
++ Zoom mode? Useful for 2-stage hint?
+ Configuration for indicator offset
+ Improve error handling in config parser
 + Wrap all parseBoolean/... into try catch that log the error with the property key and value

+ Check if the preparation is still a prefix of at least one combo.
 + If it is not, then it means a key is being pressed for longer than what the combo expects,
 + and the key can be regurgitated (just like it is regurgitated upon key release).
 + (Regurgitate only +key, not #key.)
- Regurgitate every x ms a key press until is release by user/remapper or another key is pressed.
 - Not just regurgitate, but sendinputs from remapping too
 + Mimics Windows repeat delay and repeat rate. No because apparently they are hardware-dependent.
+ Hint box border is broken for position history hints
+ It is possible to re-implement a zoom without using the Windows Magnifier:
 + https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63111438/implement-lens-magnification-to-magnify-the-windows-taskbar
   (it requires UIAccess)

+ move-to-last-selected-hint command?
- _{leftctrl} should be allowed release: _{leftctrl} +a -leftctrl +b
 - _{leftctrl} should only mean that leftctrl has to be pressed beforehand
 - Similarly ^{leftctrl}: ^{leftctrl} +a +leftctrl +b

- Hint box border: share (split 50/50) border only if there is another hint box next to it

+ Zoom
 + zoom-in=+leftshift, zoom-out commands
  + zoom.center=screen-center, mouse, last-selected-hint
  + zoom.increment-percent=4.0
 (+ zoom.max-percent, min-percent? min >= 1)
  - No zoom commands. Instead: hint2-2-mode.zoom.percent=5.0, .center=...
 - Always full screen
 - Show hints on top of zoomed window, with scaled coordinates and size
  + Also scale grid and indicator
 + smooth-zoom-enabled=true, smooth-zoom-velocity (like smooth-jump)
  + Expensive if hints need to be recomputed
   + Hide hints while animating and compute hints only once with the final zoom percent?
 + ZoomSynchronization mouse-and-zoom-center-unsynchronized, zoom-center-follows-mouse
  + Or: always follow mouse but only if it moves (otherwise stay on last-selected-hint)
   + No because doesn't work with smooth jump
   + Actually maybe because MagSetWindowSource is expensive and if we can not call it when
     moving the mouse, that is better.
- Font size, etc. should be decimals (because scaled by zoom): border width of 0.2: 0.2 * zoom(5.0) = 1px

 - https://www.codeproject.com/KB/GDI/Glow_and_Shadow_effects.aspx
- font-outline-thickness, outline-color, outline-blur=true, (offset x/y?)
- Space each hint key, font-spacing-percent=1.0 means spaced evenly across the whole cell
 - 0 means characters (hint keys) are drawn next to each other (first version: all characters at the cell center)
  - Save the width of each hint key
- logging.redact-keys=true
- Empty position history problem: add current position if empty
- hint.box-border-length=1 means one dot (of size box.thickness) as the border?
+ Clear hint cache when reloading config?
- Group hint keys (e.g. top left quadrant starts with Q, top right starts with W)
 - q w e r t a s d f g z x c v b y u i o p h j k l ; n m , . /
 - hint2-2: q w e r u i o p a s d f j k l ; z x c v m , . /
 - hint.grid-group-column-count=5, hint.grid-group-column-count=6
 - sub-grid-?
 - Increase row/col cell size until it can fit full sub-grids
  - No: draw partial sub-grid. If not enough hint keys, then switch to length 3 or 4
+ readme: hint styling showcase
+ Pre-load hint meshes on startup to avoid first time lag
 + Try caching each key drawing into a small int[][]?
 + Window hint grid: must clear draw cache if size == 10
- key-alias.hint1key.qwerty=..., key-alias.hint1key.azerty=...
 - Reload config file when layout changes?
 - Layout names: us-qwerty, uk-qwerty, italian-qwerty, french-azerty
 - Include defaults key-alias.hint1key, key-alias.hint1key.*, but if there is one
   key-alias.hint1key(.*) in the config file then ignore the defaults
   - Also include other key aliases: left/down/etc.
   - Remove the heading # character for each key-alias you want to modify.
- previous-mode-selected-hint
 - When switching mode, Map<List<Hint>, hintCenter==previous mode selected hint>
- WindowsFont that convert "Arial Bold Italic" to "Arial" + font style BoldItalic
- Divide hint cell into subcells with a sub grid style (box border thickness/length/color/opacity)
+ Click commmands that do both press and release?
 + normal-mode.reset-previous-hint-state=true
 + Goal: remove hint-xx-then-click modes, just have hint-xx- modes
 + timeout.only-if-idle: if hint not selected then not idling, otherwise hint is idling
 + Remove hint.swallow-hint-end-key-press? Always false
  + Remove mode-after-selection? Now becomes mode.to.normal-    mode=+hintkey
+ Should hint undo be a command/combo? hint1-mode.hint.undo=+backspace | +hh
 + Problem when pressing backspace when at least one hint key is selected:
   we do not want to go to another mode, but just perform the undo instead.
- Rename grid-row-oriented to layout-row-oriented
- hint-then-rightclick color
- Floating point inaccuracy issue
 - Make hint cell size independent of zoom: HintManager creates hints in full-screen unzoomed coordinates, then when
   a hint is selected, it uses the current zoom to determine the actual position of the hint
+ hint.screen-prefix-selection-keys=1 2 (default to none)
+ hint-area-filter.leftscreen=1920x1080
 + mode.hint.leftscreen.grid-cell-width
-- hint.select=^{leftalt} +hintkey -> feeds hint key press to HintManager, only if leftalt is not pressed
 + hint.selection-keys could be computed using the last (i.e. rightmost) moves of the hint.select multi-combo
 + That would allow holding modifier (e.g. +n) and a hintkey (e.g. j/k) to do a wheel command
 0- Problem with hint1-mode.to.hint2-mode=+hint1key
  0- Need to know that the combo triggers hint match. Roll back hint.mode-after-selection?
   -- Or, whenever SelectHintKey command (other than one that finalizes the hint), other commands are ignored?
   - Same for undo
   - HintManager.pollHintCommandSupercedesOtherCommands, SelectHintKey should be top priority command (executed first)
 -- hint.undo=+backspace, but problem with hint2.to.hint1=+backspace
  0- hint.break-combo-on-undo? No: hint2.hint.mode-after-noop-undo=hint1
  0- Allow hint.undo=backspace for backward compatibility
  0- Remove eat-unused-selection-keys
  0- Remove hint.mouse-movement? replace with mode.move-to-hint-grid-center=+hintkey | +backspace
    0- But how to move only when hint match? Next mode
    0- If move-to-hint-grid-center=+backspace, I may still not want to move if this also does a noop undo. Maybe =+hintkey-0 +backspace?
 -- Combo commands like selectHintKey should be inside .hint: .hint.select, .hint.undo
 + Instead of hint-then-l/m/r/click-mode, hint1-then-click-mode.hint.box-border-color._{rightbutton}=...
  (Combo precondition as part of the property key)
  + Same for hint1-mode.hint.mode-after-selection.leftctrl+leftshift=hint2-mode
+ Self feed "fake" events to ComboWatcher for automation?
 + E.g. open hint, then select and click JI to focus Firefox address bar: +rightalt -rightalt +rightalt -rightalt +j -j +space +i -i -space
